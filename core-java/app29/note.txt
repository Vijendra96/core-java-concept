1. 	Non static member cant be used in any static context straight away.
2. 	We should use non static member inside a static context along with the reference of an object.
3. 	new H(); ==> object creation statement to H class
4. 	object creation should be with a new operator.
5. 	H ref ==> reference variable creation.
6. 	We can access any non static member by using reference variable
7. 	all objects are creating in the heap memory.
8. 	non static members will be loading to the memory for every object
9. 	every object should have a reference to access the the object members (non static members)
10. 	object is also called as an instance
11. 	all non static members are also called as an instance members.
12. 	all classes are derived data type. so, H comes under derived data type.ref is a H data type. so, ref is a derived data type variable.
	all derived type variables can refer to an object.so, ref is refering to H type object. ref is a reference variable.
