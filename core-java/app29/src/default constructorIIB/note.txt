1. 	IIB => Instance Initialization Block
2. 	IIB executes for every object creation. No matter of which constructor using while object is creation, IIB executes for every object 		creation.
3. 	IIB executes only one time for one object cration. Eventhough multiple constructors are involving while one object is creating, IIB executes 		one time only.

	executes one time only.
2. 	IIB execution is object wise not a constructor wise.
1. 	static members are loading while loading a class itself. Thats why we can use static members anywhere in the class. Usage can be inside a 		constructor or IIB or SIB or any type of method.
