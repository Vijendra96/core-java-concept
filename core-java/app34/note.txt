important points on protected and public access levels :

1. private usage within the same class
2. private no inheritance
3. default usage within the same package
4. default inheritance to subclasses of within the same package
5. protected usage within the same package
6. protected inheriting to any subclass. no matter of subclass is in the same package or in the different package. It can inherit to any level of        subclasses.it acts as a private while inheriting to subclass of another package. it should be protected within the subclass while it is
   inheriting to subclass of another package. Actual protected meaning is coming into picture while it is inheriting to subclass of another package.
7. public usage can be anywhere.
8. public inheriting to any subclass. no matter of subclass is in the same package or in the different package. No restrictions incase of public.
9. private < default < protected < public
