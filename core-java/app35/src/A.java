/*
1.  if class containing minimum one abstarct class then entire class will become a incomplete class
2.  to defferntiate between concrete method/defined method/implemented method and declered method one 
	no defination/undefined method/unimpelemented method we use abstract keyword.
3.  object creation is not possible for the abstract class.
4.  abstarct class means incomplete class.
5.  defined method can not be declered as an abstract.
