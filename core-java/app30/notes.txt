=========================== INHERITANCE THEORY========================================


1.	main goal of encapsulation is a grouping together.
2.	inheritance is a reusability of code.
3.	constructors, SIBs and IIBs are not involving in inheritance. means these three are not inherited.

	contracts by the compiler ========>
1.	every class shoud have a minimum one constructor, if there is a class without a constructor the compiler will provide default constructor,
	default constructor is always no argument constructor.
2.	every constructor's first statement should be either super() calling statement or this() calling statement. if there is no super() calling 
	or this() calling statement as a first statement in the constructor then compiler develops first stetement as a super() statement.

Note: 	superclass costructors are not inheriting to the subclass constructor but subclass constructor giving a call to supercass constructor
	through super();.

3.	if there is a class without extends, then compiler keeps extends with an object class(it is in class file not java file).
	example:
	class G extends Object
	{
	   G()
	   {
              super();
	      System.out.println("G()");
	   }
	}
	class H extends G
	{
           H()
	   {
	      super();
	      System.out.println("H()");
	   }
	   public static void main(String[] args) 
	   {
	     H h1 = new H();
	   }
	}

Note:	1. only attributes, and methods can be inheriting.
	2. constructors, IIB and SIB can be not ingeriting.

4.	all IIB definations incorporeting in every constructors body after super() statement.
	in the other way, every IIb block is moving inside the constructor after super().IIB content incorporeting in the constructor immediately
	after super() statement.
	example:
	a()
	{
	   super();
	   IIB;
	   SOP;
	}
        
Note:	1.  IIBs are executing one time for on object creation.
	2.  IIB execution is object wise not constructor wise.
	3.  all IIB defination blocks are incorporeting inside a constructor, if first statement is super() calling statement.
	4.  no IIB defination blocks are incorporeting inside a constructors if the first statement is this() calling statement.
	5.  for one object creation, IIB executes only one time.
